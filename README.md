# SQPlayTest

## Test project for Unity
Short project with about 4 days worth of work. Task was to check UI skills in Unity by building two Scenes from scratch based on an .psd file.
The main required tasks took me about 2 days.

## Instructions
The tasks are all combined into one MainScene, the leftover UIScene was supposed to be the main for the 1st task but eventually I decided to combine them.
The first 3 buttons of the navigation panel (Statistics, Training, Tactics) are operational and used for navigating through the panels and reloading panels.
The First button will open the 1st tasks Info Panel, which is shown automatically when starting the project, while the 3rd button while open the popup also related to the 1st task.
The Second button is for switching from the Info Panel to the Player List panel related to the 2nd task for dynamic UI creation. The button will also refresh and load the new data fetched from an API.

## Small takeaways
The .psd files doesn't properly convert when being opened in GIMP which I mainly use for working with textures, so I had to tweak some images, and also took liberty of changing some for easier and adaptable implementation within Unity.
The main design is also 760x580, which leads to certain images being pixelated on bigger resoultions like HD. I avoided time on trying to upscale for better quality because it could of been a big time waster and was not part of the tasks.
Certain Images in the end do look diferent from the original design because of it, and you can see what is available from the example images in the scene that were used.
